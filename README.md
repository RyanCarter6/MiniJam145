# MiniJam145

Code for my game which was made in under 72 hours for a game jam. This game can be best summarized as a short 2D bossfight where they have to beat the boss to win the game.

Pretty happy with the code, probably a few tweaks could be made, but I feel like it adequately uses the principles of OOP and gets the job done in an efficient manner. This was my first time doing a game jam and I think it was a good learning experience that helped me grow as a game developer and showed me my weak areas/what I can improve upon next time.
