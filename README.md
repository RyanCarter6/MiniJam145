# MiniJam145

Code for my first game jam game which was made in under 72 hours for Mini Jam 145: Frozen. This game can be best summarized as a short 2D boss fight where the player has to beat the boss to win the game.

Pretty happy with the code, a few tweaks could probably be made, but I feel like it adequately uses the principles of OOP and gets the job done in an efficient manner. This was my first time doing a game jam and I think it was a good learning experience that helped me grow as a game developer and showed me my weak areas/what I can improve upon next time.
